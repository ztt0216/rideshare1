# Data Samples — Part 2 (Null-Pointers Rideshare)

> This document lists the prepopulated data available in the deployed app so the teaching team can test without creating data.  
> **Timezone:** All availability windows are in **Australia/Melbourne** time (AEST/AEDT).

## 2) Driver Availability (pre-seeded)

All times are local (Australia/Melbourne), end time is **exclusive** (e.g., 09:00 ≤ now < 17:00).

### testdriver2@mail.com
| Day      | Start | End  |
|----------|-------|------|
| Monday   | 09:00 | 17:00 |
| Tuesday  | 09:00 | 17:00 |
| Wednesday| 09:00 | 17:00 |
| Thursday | 09:00 | 17:00 |
| Friday   | 09:00 | 17:00 |

### testdriver3@mail.com
| Day    | Start | End  |
|--------|-------|------|
| Saturday | 18:00 | 23:00 |
| Sunday   | 18:00 | 23:00 |

### testdriver1@mail.com
- **No availability rows** (intentionally blank). This driver can view and accept at any time.

## 3) Seeded Ride Requests (REQUESTED)

These sample rides cover all fare rules. IDs are auto-generated by the database.

| Pickup → Destination | Expected Fare Rule | Expected Fare |
|--------------------- |------------------- |--------------|
| 3045 → 3000          | Airport (if either end is 3045) | **$60.00** |
| 3056 → 2000          | Interstate (not in 3xxx)        | **$500.00** |
| 3056 → 3350          | Regional (Vic but not 3000–3299) | **$220.00** |
| 3000 → 3056          | Metro (3000–3299 only)          | **$40.00** |

> Additional rides may be created during demos; the four above should always exist after a fresh deploy/seed.

## 4) How to Test Quickly

### A. Rider creates a new Metro request
1. Login as **testrider1@mail.com**.
2. Enter **Pickup 3000**, **Destination 3056**.
3. Click **Get Fare & Confirm** → fare preview should be **$40.00**.
4. Click **Confirm** → a new `REQUESTED` ride is created.

### B. Driver inside window can view & accept
1. During **Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00 (AEST/AEDT)**, login as **testdriver2@mail.com**.  
2. The **Requested Rides** list should be visible (inside window).  
3. Click **Accept** on any `REQUESTED` ride → it becomes assigned to this driver.

### C. Driver outside window cannot view the list
1. Outside the above window (e.g., Mon 20:00), login as **testdriver2@mail.com**.  
2. You should see a notice like **“You’re currently outside your availability window.”** and **no list**.  
3. Login as **testdriver1@mail.com** (no availability configured) at the same time → the list is visible and rides are accept-able.

## 5) Fare Rules (for reference)

Rules are checked **in this order**:

1. **Airport Fare** — if either end is **3045**, fare = **$60.00**.  
2. **Interstate Fare** — if either end is **not in 3xxx**, fare = **$500.00**.  
3. **Regional Fare** — otherwise, if either end is **3300–3999**, fare = **$220.00**.  
4. **Metro Fare** — otherwise (both ends **3000–3299**), fare = **$40.00**.
