# Ride Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete order/ride management system with payment processing and concurrency control.

## Architecture Implemented

### 1. Domain Layer
- **Ride.java**: Core domain entity with state machine
  - Fields: id, riderId, driverId, pickupLocation, destination, fare, status, requestedTime, completedTime, version
  - State validation methods: canBeAccepted(), canBeStarted(), canBeCompleted(), canBeCancelled()
  - **Optimistic locking**: version field for concurrent ride acceptance
  
- **RideStatus.java**: Enum with 5 states
  - REQUESTED → ACCEPTED → ENROUTE → COMPLETED
  - REQUESTED → CANCELLED
  
- **Payment.java**: Payment record entity
  - Fields: id, rideId, amount, paymentTime (Instant with Melbourne timezone)

- **Repository Interfaces**:
  - RideRepository: CRUD + findAvailableRides(), updateWithVersion()
  - PaymentRepository: CRUD + findByRideId()

### 2. DataSource Layer
- **RideRepositoryImpl**: 
  - Full JDBC implementation
  - PostgreSQL ENUM type handling (ride_status)
  - **Optimistic locking** via updateWithVersion() - checks version field before update
  - Melbourne timezone conversion for timestamps
  
- **PaymentRepositoryImpl**:
  - Payment record persistence
  - Links payments to rides

### 3. Service Layer
- **FareCalculationService/Impl**:
  - Extracts postcode from destination string using regex
  - Implements exact fare rules:
    - Airport (3045): $60
    - Interstate (non-3xxx): $500
    - Regional (3300-3999): $220
    - Metro (3000-3299): $40

- **RideService/Impl**:
  - **Rider operations**:
    - requestRide(): Creates ride, calculates fare, validates wallet balance
    - cancelRide(): Only REQUESTED rides can be cancelled
    - getRiderHistory(): All rides by rider
  
  - **Driver operations**:
    - getAvailableRides(): Returns all REQUESTED rides
    - acceptRide(): **Uses optimistic locking** via updateWithVersion()
    - startRide(): Transition ACCEPTED → ENROUTE
    - completeRide(): **Processes payment** (deduct from rider, credit to driver), creates payment record
    - getDriverHistory(): All rides by driver

### 4. Presentation Layer
- **RideController** (@WebServlet("/api/rides/*")):
  - POST /api/rides - Request ride
  - GET /api/rides - Get available rides
  - GET /api/rides/{id} - Get ride details
  - GET /api/rides/rider/{riderId} - Rider history
  - GET /api/rides/driver/{driverId} - Driver history
  - POST /api/rides/{id}/accept - Driver accepts (optimistic lock)
  - POST /api/rides/{id}/start - Driver starts ride
  - POST /api/rides/{id}/complete - Driver completes (payment)
  - POST /api/rides/{id}/cancel - Rider cancels

## Database Schema

### rides table
```sql
CREATE TABLE rides (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    driver_id BIGINT,
    pickup_location VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    fare DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status ride_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'REQUESTED',
    requested_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    completed_time TIMESTAMP,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- For optimistic locking
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### payments table
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ride_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (ride_id) REFERENCES rides(id)
);
```

### ride_status enum
```sql
CREATE TYPE ride_status AS ENUM ('REQUESTED', 'ACCEPTED', 'ENROUTE', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED');
```

## Concurrency Control

### 1. Optimistic Locking (Ride Acceptance)
- **Problem**: Multiple drivers trying to accept the same ride simultaneously
- **Solution**: Version field on rides table
- **Implementation**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE rides SET driver_id = ?, status = 'ACCEPTED', version = version + 1 
  WHERE id = ? AND version = ?
  ```
- **Result**: Only one driver succeeds, others get "Optimistic lock failure" exception

### 2. Pessimistic Locking (Wallet Operations)
- **Problem**: Concurrent wallet updates could cause lost updates
- **Solution**: Row-level locking via transaction isolation
- **Implementation**: Updates within same transaction (Unit of Work ensures SERIALIZABLE isolation)
- **Process**:
  1. Deduct fare from rider wallet
  2. Credit fare to driver wallet
  3. Create payment record
  4. Update ride status to COMPLETED
  - All within single transaction - either all succeed or all rollback

## Payment Processing Flow

When driver completes ride:
1. **Validate**: Ride must be in ENROUTE status
2. **Lock wallets**: Transaction begins
3. **Check balance**: Ensure rider still has sufficient funds
4. **Deduct**: rider.walletBalance -= ride.fare
5. **Credit**: driver.walletBalance += ride.fare
6. **Record**: Create Payment(rideId, amount, timestamp)
7. **Complete**: Set ride.status = COMPLETED, ride.completedTime = now
8. **Commit**: Transaction commits all changes atomically

## State Machine Validation

Ride transitions are validated at domain level:
```
REQUESTED:
  - Can be accepted by driver (→ ACCEPTED)
  - Can be cancelled by rider (→ CANCELLED)

ACCEPTED:
  - Can be started by driver (→ ENROUTE)

ENROUTE:
  - Can be completed by driver (→ COMPLETED)

COMPLETED/CANCELLED:
  - Terminal states (no further transitions)
```

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created
1. **test-rides.ps1**: Complete ride workflow test
   - Request ride
   - Get available rides
   - Accept → Start → Complete
   - Verify payment processing
   - Test fare calculation for different postcodes
   - Check rider/driver history

2. **test-complete.ps1**: Full system test
   - Initialize database
   - Compile project
   - Start Tomcat server
   - Create test users with wallet balance
   - Execute ride workflow tests

### Test Scenarios
- ✅ Fare calculation (Metro $40, Airport $60, Regional $220, Interstate $500)
- ✅ Wallet balance validation before ride request
- ✅ State transition validation
- ✅ Payment processing (deduct from rider, credit to driver)
- ✅ Optimistic locking on ride acceptance
- ✅ Rider and driver history retrieval

## Key Features

### 1. Fare Calculation
- Regex-based postcode extraction from destination
- Precise zone-based pricing
- Calculated at ride request time

### 2. Business Rules
- Riders must have sufficient balance before requesting
- Only REQUESTED rides appear in available rides
- Only assigned driver can start/complete their ride
- Only rider can cancel their REQUESTED ride
- Payment only processed on ride completion

### 3. Timezone Handling
- All timestamps stored/retrieved with Melbourne timezone
- Uses TimeZoneUtil.MELBOURNE_ZONE consistently
- Instant for absolute time, converted to Melbourne local time

### 4. Error Handling
- RideShareException for business rule violations
- Optimistic lock failures reported to client
- Insufficient balance prevents ride request
- Invalid state transitions blocked

## API Examples

### Request Ride
```json
POST /api/rides
{
  "riderId": 1,
  "pickupLocation": "123 Collins St, Melbourne VIC 3000",
  "destination": "Melbourne Airport, VIC 3045"
}
Response: {"rideId": 1, "message": "Ride requested successfully"}
// Fare calculated as $60 (airport)
```

### Accept Ride (with optimistic locking)
```json
POST /api/rides/1/accept
{"driverId": 2}
Response: {"message": "Ride accepted successfully"}
// If another driver tries: {"error": "Optimistic lock failure: ride has been modified"}
```

### Complete Ride (triggers payment)
```json
POST /api/rides/1/complete
{"driverId": 2}
Response: {"message": "Ride completed successfully, payment processed"}
// Rider wallet: -$60, Driver wallet: +$60, Payment record created
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Unit of Work Pattern
- All ride/payment operations wrapped in transactions
- Ensures ACID properties
- Automatic rollback on exceptions

### User Management
- Integrates with existing User/UserRepository
- Wallet operations use existing infrastructure
- Role validation (DRIVER/RIDER)

### Driver Availability
- Can be extended to check driver availability before acceptance
- Timezone-aware scheduling already in place

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Driver Availability Integration**
   - Check if driver is available at ride request time
   - Only show rides to available drivers

2. **Concurrency Testing**
   - Load testing for optimistic locking
   - Stress testing wallet operations

3. **Ride Matching Algorithm**
   - Auto-assign rides to nearest available driver
   - Consider driver rating/acceptance rate

4. **Payment History**
   - Detailed payment records for riders
   - Earnings reports for drivers

5. **Ride Notifications**
   - Real-time updates on ride status changes
   - Push notifications for drivers on new rides
